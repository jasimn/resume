                <h3>Linux</h3>
                <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution (or distro for short), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.

                    Key Features of Linux:
                   1. Open Source: Linux is free and open-source, meaning its source code is available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

                   2. Multi-User and Multi-Tasking: Linux supports multiple users and can run multiple processes simultaneously.
                    
                   3. Security: Linux is known for its strong security model, with features like user permissions, SELinux, and AppArmor.

                <h3>git</h3>
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) used to track changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. Git is widely used for collaborative projects, enabling multiple developers to work on the same codebase efficiently.

                    Key Features of Git:
                    Distributed: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history, allowing offline work and redundancy.
